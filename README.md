### Project Description
A Universal Windows Platform application intended to run under Windows IOT Core on a Raspberry Pi, driving external LED strips to indicate build / test status.

### Motivation
This project was born of frustration at being one of the first developers into the office, and a long run of getting latest only to find that it had been left broken the day before.  The idea is to have a visual indicator that is impossible to miss, tied to the build server, so that breaking commits can't fly under the radar.
